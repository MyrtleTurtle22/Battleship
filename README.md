# Battleship
console-based 2 player battleship

## HOW TO RUN:
Compile and run Main.java to start the game.

## BATTLESHIP RULES:

### OBJECT OF THE GAME:
Be the first to sink all 5 of your opponent's ships.

### SHIPS:
Battleship - Size 5
Aircraft Carrier - Size 4
Cruiser - Size 3
Submarine - Size 3
Destroyer - Size 2

### PREPARE FOR BATTLE:
You and your opponent each place your 5 ships on the grid.  
Ships must be placed horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.
A ship cannot be placed where any part of it overlaps letters, numbers, the edge of the grid or another ship.
Ships cannot change position once the game begins.

### BATTLE:
Player 1 goes first.

### SELECT YOUR TARGET:
On your turn, pick a target on your attack grid by its row and column number.  The rows and columns on your attack grid correspond to the rows and columns on your opponent's ship grid.  When you select your target, you will immediately find out if your attack was a hit or a miss.

### IT'S A HIT:
If you select a target that is occupied by a ship on your opponent's ship grid, your attack is a hit! The game will tell you which ship you have hit.  The game will record your shot by placing an 'X' on your attack board.

### IT'S A MISS:
If you select a target that is not occupied by an opponent's ship, it's a miss.  The game will record your shot by placing an 'O' on your attack board.  

Play continues in this manner, with you and your opponent calling one shot per turn.

### SINKING A SHIP:
Once each grid position on a ship has been hit, it has been sunk.  The game will announce which ship was sunk.  

WINNING THE GAME:
If you're the first player to sink your opponent's entire fleet of 5 ships, you win the game!
